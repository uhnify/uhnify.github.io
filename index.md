## Goals

People attend college with many goals in mind, and a relatively common goal is meeting like-minded people and forging lifelong relationships. Clubs and activities serve as great avenues for accomplishing this goal. However, many students can be unaware of the many different clubs offered on campus and figuring out this information can be time-consuming. The UHnify app aims to remedy this issue by offering a single site for students attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa to access consolidated information on the many clubs and resources available on campus. 

## Future

Utilizing tools such as:
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)

UHnify will allow users to create an account. Once the account is created, users will be able to search for a specific topic or club, and all the relevant information will be immediately retrieved. Users can then add the club to a list of clubs they are interested in. At any time, the user could access this list and retrieve information from any club on said list. Finally, UHnify can recommend different clubs associated with the user's clubs. 

UHnify will consist of 5 different pages, including one landing page. These pages are: 

* Landing
* My Clubs
* Clubs
* Similar Clubs
* Login
